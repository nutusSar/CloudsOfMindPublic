## Mocking
Mocking allows to test against the Code we want to test and not against our entire program.
+ **Dummies**: Simple Objects
+ **Stubs**: Have controlable behaviour
+ **Spies**: Keep track of which Methodes got called (count and parameters)
+ **True mocks**: Controlable behaviour and lets you see which methodes got called

## Types of Unit Tests in Angular
+ **Isolated**: Testing a single piece of Code, "constructing the code via hand" using the new keyword
+ **Integration**: Uses a special testing utility provided bye the Angularteam called the Testbed (test coomponent and template together)
